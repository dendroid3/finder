# FINDER CONTRIBUTION GUIDE
## PROJECT DESIGN
The project is styled using an MVC architecture ![https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/mvc-architecture-system-design/] heavily inspired Laravel ![https://laravel.com/]
Think of this system as five portfolio building systems combined into one. The main separation is in the UI (views).
Ideally, each member should have created all the pages required by the user allowing them to pick the design they like.
